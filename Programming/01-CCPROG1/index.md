   * CS50X tackles the foundation of computer science very effectively -- if you can finish this (projects included), then you can definitely win CCPROG1 (and a lot more courses!)
2. [The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition by Kernighan & Ritchie](http://cslabcms.nju.edu.cn/problem_solving/images/c/cc/The_C_Programming_Language_%282nd_Edition_Ritchie_Kernighan%29.pdf)
    * In CCPROG1, you will be programming in the C programming language. If you want to read about C from the makers of C, look no further than the book they wrote about it.
